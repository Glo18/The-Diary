         <h1>Akan names</h1>
          <p>These are names given to children according to the day they were born.
              This method is derived from the <em>Ghanian culture</em>.
              Most people have no idea what day they were born.
              Therefore, using the little information people have about their birth dates they can also find out the day they were born</p>
